Breaking: `defineEnv` now validates in every environment. `CI` and `lint` runs no longer skip validation. The only implicit opt-out is `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` (exactly `1`); set it only in build stages that run without secrets. `options.skipValidation` still overrides it. The `@arki/env/dot` plugin now validates at boot and fails with `ARKI_ENV_PLUGIN_E001` (new `ENV_PLUGIN_ERROR_CODES`), and `EnvServices['env']` is derived from `defineEnv` without a cast.
