# @arki/dot

## 0.1.0

### Initial release

- First public publication on npm (experimental track) — 2026-05-21.

  **`@arki/dot`** is the application composition kernel — "the dot at the center" that every ARKI app boots through. It defines:

  - **`defineApp`** — the contract every consumer uses to declare an app shape
  - **5-hook lifecycle** — `configure` → `boot` → `start` → `stop` → `dispose`
  - **`DotAppManifest` + `DotDiagnosticsSnapshot`** — the 5-array introspection contract every adapter contributes to (`env`, `database`, `cache`, `events`, `jobs`)
  - **`DotPipError`** — structured error envelope for hook failures
  - **OTel-first observability** — `dot.app.<phase>` + `dot.pip.<hook>` spans, two duration histograms, `arki:dot:lifecycle` logger with trace correlation
  - **`dot` CLI** — `dot new`, `dot explain`, `dot doctor`, all emitting agent-native JSON envelopes

  **Why `0.1.x`, not `0.0.x`**: Wave 1's foundation packages shipped at `0.0.x` because they're zero-dependency utilities — the "this is just a function library" tier. `@arki/dot` is the layer above: experimental in its own right (no API stability promise yet), but the boot contract has been exercised through multiple internal apps and verified by the scorecard's `dot-gates` probe (3-adapter boot + manifest/diagnostics 5-array check + CLI envelope shape). The `0.1.x` stream signals "kernel layer, experimental but past first integration." API breakage may still happen at any `0.1.x` boundary.

  **Dependencies** (all live on npm at `0.0.1`):

  - `@arki/assert` `0.0.1`
  - `@arki/contracts` `0.0.1`
  - `@arki/log` `0.0.1`

  Wave 3 adapters (`@arki/db`, `@arki/kv`, `@arki/event-sourcing`) ship together with this release.
