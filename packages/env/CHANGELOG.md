# @arki/env

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Ship TypeScript source in the npm tarball (`src/**` added to `files`). npm installs and the read-only GitHub mirrors now carry the original `.ts` source alongside compiled `dist/` — better debuggability on the experimental track. No runtime changes.
- Updated dependencies
  - @arki/dot@0.1.2

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- DOT v2 pip contract — typed dependency injection (BREAKING on the experimental track).

  `pip()` replaces `defineDotPip`: pips declare consumed services as `needs` shapes of type witnesses (`service<T>()` app-local, `token<T>()('key')` cross-package) and hooks destructure them fully typed; provides are inferred from `boot`'s return value. `.use()` is compile-time guarded (unsatisfied needs, type mismatches, wire-key collisions fail at the call site). Declaration order is boot order — the topological sort and name-based `dependencies` are gone; manifest dependency edges are observed from actual wiring. `rename(pip, map, name?)` is the multi-instance primitive, replacing the adapters' silent last-writer-wins `name` options. `lazy(init, { dispose? })` defers expensive opens behind a memoized single-flight `Lazy<T>` handle the kernel auto-disposes; `service.lazy<T>()` lifts eager or lazy providers into a uniform handle. The four `/dot` adapters (`@arki/env`, `@arki/kv`, `@arki/db`, `@arki/event-sourcing`) are migrated to the new contract.

## 0.0.1

### Initial release

- First public publication on npm (experimental track) — 2026-05-21.

  Part of **Wave 1**, the ARKI foundation: zero-dependency utilities and runtime primitives shipped together because every downstream wave (DOT kernel, infrastructure adapters) consumes them. Wave 1 packages: `assert`, `clock`, `contracts`, `date`, `env`, `log`, `resilience`, `slugify`, `string`, `ts`.

  **Why 0.0.x, not 1.0.0**: ARKI is on an experimental track. The 0.0.x prefix is an honest signal — APIs may change without semver discipline until the kernel is field-tested. The release scorecard (metadata, privacy, dependencies, build-output, packlist, docs, fixtures, DOT gates, agent-native gates) is satisfied at this version; the gate certifies _the artifact_, not _API stability_. Stability is earned through reuse, not declared at first publication.

  Wave 2 (`@arki/dot`) and Wave 3 (`@arki/db`, `@arki/kv`, `@arki/event-sourcing`) publish in subsequent releases once their inter-package transitive resolution against the public npm registry is verified.
