 * to add to the context, or a failure to refuse the call:
 *
 *   const authed = (ctx: { principal: Principal | null }) =>
 *     ctx.principal === null ? SignInRequired() : { principal: ctx.principal };
 *
 * A refusal answers with the same envelope as a refused `derive`, so every
 * route bound after the step must declare the step's failures. The return must
 * be an object (or a failure), sync or async. The same function attaches to
 * the other transports with their own `step`.
 *
 * `failureHeaders` adds response headers to a refusal, typed by the step's
 * own failures (a `www-authenticate` challenge on a 401, say), as on `derive`.

 * (as the response) or a handler error (as a throw). For an SSE route it wraps
