/**
 * DOT adapter for `@arki/http` — the `http()` entrypoint.
 *
 * `http()` is an entrypoint: `.entrypoints(http(...))` binds it to the features the
 * app mounted, and it serves every feature's `routes` slice — declared with
 * `endpoints(core, build)` from this module in a `defineFeature` feature's
 * `.entrypoints(...)`, or with `endpoints(build)` from `@arki/http` in an
 * object-form feature's `use` list. The app never lists its features twice:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { defineApp } from '@arki/dot';
 * import { http } from '@arki/http/dot';
 *
 * const app = await defineApp('shop-api')
 *   .infra(db({ url }))
 *   .features([orders, billing])   // each declares `use: [endpoints(build)]`
 *   .entrypoints(http({ port: 3000 }))
 *   .start();
 * ```
 *
 * Route bundles published as plain token services (not features) are
 * listed in `bundles`. Each becomes a need, so the builder's wiring guard
 * rejects the app at compile time unless an earlier unit provides it.
 * Bundle routes come first in the route table, then feature routes in
 * mount order.
 *
 * Lifecycle mapping — `.entrypoints()` mounts after every feature, which is what
 * makes the drain order right:
 *
 *  - `provides.httpServer` — collect bundles, build the router, publish `httpServer`.
 *                NOT listening yet; all feature boots finish first.
 *  - `start`   — listen (first among starts — the route table is final).
 *  - `stop`    — stop accepting, drain in-flight handlers
 *                (`drainTimeoutMs`). Reverse order puts this FIRST:
 *                ingress stops before features tear down.
 *  - `dispose` — sever remaining connections (open SSE streams end here)
 *                and release the port.
 *
 * `@arki/dot` is an OPTIONAL peer of `@arki/http`. Importing this adapter
 * without `@arki/dot` installed fails at module load — intentional: the
 * adapter only makes sense inside a DOT app.
