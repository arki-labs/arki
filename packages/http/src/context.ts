/**
 * Ambient request context — the last resort.
 *
 * Explicit `ctx` threading fails in one honest case: code deep in a call
 * stack whose signatures you don't control (log enrichment inside a
 * shared library). For that, this entry exposes the current request's
 * {@link BaseRequestCtx} via `AsyncLocalStorage`.
 *
 * Ambient context is a smell — prefer the explicit `ctx` parameter and
 * derivers everywhere a signature is yours to change. Note that OTel
 * trace context already propagates this way, so span/log correlation
 * needs none of this.
 *
 * This module is deliberately NOT re-exported from the package root.
 * Import it as `@arki/http/context`.
